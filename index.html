        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Neural Network for Predicting Network Failure</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To develop a predictive model using neural networks that can analyze network traffic and system metrics to identify potential failure points before they occur.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Our approach includes traffic pattern analysis, system metric analysis, failure simulations using ns-3 or Mininet, and hybrid modeling techniques. We will implement the solution in Python using TensorFlow or PyTorch.</p>
        <p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> A prototype system capable of accurately predicting network failures, contributing to proactive maintenance and improved network reliability.</p>
