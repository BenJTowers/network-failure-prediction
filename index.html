        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Our research focuses on leveraging neural networks to predict network failures. By analyzing traffic patterns and system metrics, we aim to enhance the reliability of network infrastructures and prevent potential downtimes.</p>

        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Neural Network for Predicting Network Failure</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To develop a predictive model using neural networks that can analyze network traffic and system metrics to identify potential failure points before they occur.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Our approach includes traffic pattern analysis, system metric analysis, failure simulations using ns-3 or Mininet, and hybrid modeling techniques. We will implement the solution in Python using TensorFlow or PyTorch.</p>
        <p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> A prototype system capable of accurately predicting network failures, contributing to proactive maintenance and improved network reliability.</p>

        <h2>Midterm Update</h2>
        <p><strong>Dataset Selection:</strong> We have switched from our initial plan of using generic public datasets to adopting the 
            <em>SOFI dataset (“Symptom-fault relationship for IP-network”)</em>. This dataset provides a labeled collection 
            of normal (“NE”) versus faulty (“F”) network states captured from a large, emulated IP network. It includes 
            SNMP-based performance metrics and covers a range of artificially induced failures such as link down events, 
            line card failures, and high link utilization.</p>
        <p><strong>Reason for the Change:</strong> The SOFI dataset’s clear labeling and rich feature set (e.g., inbound/outbound 
            packets, error rates, operational status) make it ideal for training our predictive model. It also aligns 
            with real-world conditions where failure instances can be rare.</p>
        <p><strong>Progress:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Preprocessed the dataset (label encoding, scaling) and confirmed class imbalance (~1.5% failures). 
                    We are addressing this through class weighting and potential oversampling methods.</li>
                <li>Developed an initial feedforward neural network, achieving high accuracy but a moderate recall 
                    for the minority “failure” class.</li>
                <li>Planned next steps include comparing other ML algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) 
                    and incorporating time-based splitting to capture sequential patterns more effectively.</li>
            </ul>
